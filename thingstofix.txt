1) need to use slide faces for probe wings
2) it marks group as used when no face is found, does not clear
3) attachment points arent replaced when no match is found
4) attachment points arent being created for anything except wings and direct drive mounts
5) it deletes parent models when removing a model, and doesnt clear the used group
6) maybe make it recursively check which models are rendered and which groups they use to reset the base's used groups
